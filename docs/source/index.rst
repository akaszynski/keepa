Here's an example of obtaining a product and plotting its price and offer history:

.. code:: python

    import keepa

    # establish interface with keepa (this is not a real key)
    mykey = '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
    api = keepa.Keepa(mykey)

    # plot product request 
    request = 'B0088PUEPK'
    products = api.query(request)
    product = products[0]
    keepa.plot_product(product)

.. figure:: ./images/Product_Price_Plot.png
